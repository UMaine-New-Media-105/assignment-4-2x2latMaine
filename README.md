A4Q1: https://editor.p5js.org/maxxkeoni219/sketches/2mt4kOU82

For my first question, I created a simple flower that has customizeable color, size, location, and petal amount. If the petals are yellow, the flower bulb will change to brown.

For this sketch, I created 3 objects that create 3 different looking flowers. The flowers are set in a group together and spaced out according to my design. Then, they are called in a nested loop that will place them multiple times in however many rows or columns is set using the rows and columns variables.

This sketch built off the last question. I added randomness to the location, rotation, size, and color to each flower called. I did this by adding a random() function before calling my flowers within the nested loop.

This sketch was pretty simple to integrate into my previous code. I was able to use the same object flower1, and then I created petalsArray and gave it values 1-10. I then added a command right before the call function for drawFlower that will change the value of petals to whatever is called from the array.
